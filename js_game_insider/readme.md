# Features

* Three different game modes: user-controlled, automatic, and 2-ball mode
* Adjustable game speed
* Scores and winning score are configurable
* Stylish, colorful graphics

# Controls
* Press 'M' for user-controlled game
* Press 'A' for automatic game
* Press 'B' for 2-ball mode
* Use the up and down arrow keys to move the sticks in user-controlled and automatic modes

# Configuration
You can adjust the game's behavior by modifying the following constants in the CONSTS object:

* gameSpeed: the interval at which the game updates, in milliseconds
* score1: the starting score for player 1
* score2: the starting score for player 2
* winning_score: the score needed to win the game
* stick1Speed: the speed at which player 1's stick moves, in pixels per game update
* stick2Speed: the speed at which player 2's stick moves, in pixels per game update
* ballTopSpeed: the initial vertical velocity of the ball, in pixels per game update
* ballLeftSpeed: the initial horizontal velocity of the ball, in pixels per game update
* You can also adjust the appearance of the game by modifying the styles in the CSS object.

# Explanation

The project defines a ping pong game using the jQuery library. It creates and styles various HTML elements, including a game arena, a ball, sticks, and score elements, using jQuery's $('<element>', {attributes}) and .css(styles) functions. It also sets up event listeners using jQuery's .keydown() and .keyup() functions to allow player input, and it defines a game loop using setInterval() to update the game state.

The code begins by defining a constant object, CONSTS, which stores various values used throughout the game, including the game speed, scores, winning score, stick speeds, ball speeds, and other game-related constants. It also defines CSS styles for the various HTML elements in the game in the CSS object, including the width, height, and positioning of the elements, as well as their background colors and font styles.

The start() function is called to start the game. It calls several other functions: draw(), which creates and styles the HTML elements for the game using jQuery; setEvents(), which sets up event listeners for player input; roll(), which initializes the ball's starting position and velocity; and loop(), which is the main game loop that updates the game state and redraws the game elements at a regular interval.

The draw() function creates the game arena and various game elements using jQuery and applies the styles defined in the CSS object. It creates an outer div element with an id of "pong-game" and applies the arena styles to it, then appends it to the body element. It then creates various other elements, including the ball, sticks, and score elements, and applies the appropriate styles to each element.

The setEvents() function sets up event listeners using jQuery's .keydown() and .keyup() functions to allow player input. It listens for the "M" and "A" keys to toggle between different game modes, and it listens for the up and down arrow keys to move the sticks.

The roll() function initializes the ball's starting position and velocity. It sets the ball's position to the center of the game arena and sets its velocity using the constants defined in the CONSTS object.

The loop() function is the main game loop that updates the game state and redraws the game elements at a regular interval. It uses setInterval() to call itself repeatedly at a given interval, and it updates the positions of the ball and sticks and checks for collisions and scoring. It also updates the score and displays it on the screen.
  
Inside the loop() function, the positions of the ball and sticks are updated based on their velocities. The ball's position is updated by adding its vertical and horizontal velocities (ballTopSpeed and ballLeftSpeed) to its current top and left positions. The sticks' positions are updated by adding their vertical velocities (stick1Speed and stick2Speed) to their current top positions.

The loop() function also checks for collisions and scoring. If the ball hits the top or bottom of the game arena, its vertical velocity is reversed. If the ball hits the left or right side of the game arena, it is scored and its position is reset to the center of the game arena. The score is updated accordingly, and the ball's velocity is also reset.

Finally, the loop() function updates the score display on the screen by setting the innerHTML of the score element to the current scores of both players. It then calls itself again using setInterval(), with the interval defined by the gameSpeed constant in the CONSTS object, to continue the game loop.
